# RPS Retro Fighting Game

Welcome to the repository for my RPS Retro Fighting Game! This is a classic Rock Paper Scissors game reimagined as a retro fighting game with custom assets and sprites. It features a parody of the Terminator movies universe where humans fight machines and humanity's fate is decided by a game of Rock Paper Scissors.
